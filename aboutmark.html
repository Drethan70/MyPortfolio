<p>I have had a passion for IT since the mid-90s when I first started building PCs from bare components which led me to build numerous machines over the last 30 years installing everything from Motherboards, PSUs, Ram, GPU, HDD, SDD, CPU, Cooling systems (Liquid and traditional fan).<br><br><br><br>
  I have installed every version of Windows since windows 3.11 except server versions.<br><br><br><br>
     I have resolved issues resulting in problems with an OS installation or corruption of OS files and failed hardware.<br><br><br><br>
     I have worked as a Technical Support Advisor in a call centre, taking calls from customers who have an issue with a device they have bought.  This improved my ability to communicate and listen to people from all walks of life and helped me troubleshoot their issue.<br><br><br><br>
     I have gained me my CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2 Certification.  I also studied my MD-102 Microsoft 365 Endpoint Administrator and my MS-102 Microsoft 356 Administrator courses.<br><br><br><br>
     I have decided that I would like to further my knowledge by embarking on a Software Development course which will teach me HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript and Python.
